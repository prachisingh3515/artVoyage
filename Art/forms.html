        <p class="para-p1">
          The Madhubani paintings or Mithila paintings originated in the
          Madhubani village of Bihar and are mostly created by women. This type
          of Indian painting uses many tools like fingers, twigs, brushes,
          nib-pens, matchsticks, and natural colors. These are done on walls,
          floors of holy places, canvases, etc. These brightly colored Madhubani
          paintings are characterized by their geometrical patterns.<br /><br />
          Originally, these paintings were done on mud walls and soil ground or
          floors. Now, they are also done on canvases, cloth, and handmade
          paper. It is one of the most celebrated and popular styles of folk
          painting in India.

        <p class="para-p2">
          The Warli paintings, created by the Warli tribe, residing in the north
          Sahyadri Range is one such priceless folk art form that though carried
          on for years by the tribe has found fame, appreciation and usability
          in today’s modern times.<br /><br />The biggest appeal of the Warli
          paintings is their simplicity. They essentially use very basic
          geometric shapes, the circle, triangle, square and dotted lines to
          construct and create magic on their mud walls. Even the color scheme
          is extremely simplistic, with the usage of white pigment as paint and
          a mixture of branches, earth and red bricks that act as the canvas or
          backdrop.

        <h1 class="heading">Kalamkari Painting</h1>
        <p class="para-p1">
          Kalamkari originated in the modern-day states of Andhra Pradesh and
          Telangana several hundred years ago. It was first used to portray
          scenes from sacred texts such as the Mahabharata, Ramayana and
          Bhagavatam. These paintings were often displayed as decorative
          backdrops in temples, depicting the stories of deities.<br /><br />Kalamkari
          artists employ two distinct techniques to create their masterpieces:
          Srikalahasti and Machilipatnam styles.<br />Srikalahasti Style: This
          technique involves freehand drawing with a pen-like instrument called
          a kalam (hence the name Kalamkari). The kalam is a bamboo or palm reed
          with a sharp point that allows the artist to draw intricate lines and
          fine details.

        <p class="para-p2">
          Mapping lineage is the most problematic area in folk and tribal arts
          because of limited availability of archival resources or objects, the
          inherent impermanence of the materials and methods involved in the
          creative process. The historical evolution of ‘Gond’, or Pardhan
          painting or ‘Jangarh kalam,’ has to be understood in this background.
          A community of around four million people spread all over central
          India, Gonds have a recorded history of 1400 years. The word ‘Gond’
          comes from the Dravidian expression ‘Kond’ which means ‘green
          mountain’.<br /><br />Pictorial art on walls and floors has been part
          of the domestic life of Gonds, specially among Pardhans since it is
          done with the construction and re- construction of each and every
          house, with local colors and materials like charcoal, coloured soil,
          plant sap, leaves, cow dung, lime stone powder, etc.

        <h1 class="heading">Patachitra Painting</h1>
        <p class="para-p1">
          Patachitra or Pattachitra is a traditional, cloth scroll painting art
          form from the state of Odisha and West Bengal. The art form mainly
          depicts mythological and religious themes, epic, Hindu deities, etc.
          Thia Badhia – a depiction of the temple of Lord Jagannath, Krishna
          Lila – an enactment of Lord Jagannath as Lord Krishna displays his
          powers as a child, Dasabatara Patti – the ten incarnations of Lord
          Vishnu and Panchamukhi – Lord Ganesh’s depiction as a five-headed
          deity are some of the popular themes that are represented by the
          Patachitra art form.<br /><br />
          The word ‘Patachitra’ is derived from patta meaning cloth and Chitra
          meaning picture. The colors used are natural and vibrant like white,
          yellow, and red, and black with bold and strong outlines and
          decorative borders.

        <p class="para-p2">
          Mandana art form is decorative, tribal, and one of the oldest forms of
          Indian art. It is drawn on the walls and floors of houses in Rajasthan
          and Madhya Pradesh as a way to protect their home and fireplace.
          Mandanas are made to welcome gods and also on a festive occasion.<br /><br />
          The women of the Meena community in Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh are
          the first Mandana artists. The Mandana paintings are very simple yet
          eye-catching. These paintings are made using a piece of cotton, twigs,
          a bunch of squirrel hair, and a simple brush made from a date stick.
          The base is prepared using cow dung mixed with rati (local clay),
          water, and red ochre. For making the motif, lime, brick, and chalk
          powder are used.

        <h1 class="heading">Rajput Painting</h1>
        <p class="para-p1">
          The Rajput paintings, also known as Rajasthani paintings, originated
          and flourished in the Rajputana royal courts in the state of Rajasthan
          around the 17th and 18th centuries. The main illustrations are the
          Hindu epics, Mahabharata and Ramayana, and scenes from Hindu
          mythology. <br /><br />The paintings are done with very minute details
          and bold colors. The colors used are extracted from minerals, plant
          sources, clams and shells, vegetables, and even from precious stones.
          Pure gold and silver were also used. The preparation of these colors
          took weeks and months and the brushes used are made from the hair of
          squirrels and are very fine. These Rajput paintings were mostly done
          on the walls of palaces, inner chambers of the forts, and Havelis.

        <p class="para-p2">
          This tribal art form from the state of Odisha is a type of mural
          painting and is visually very similar to the Warli paintings. The
          Saura paintings are also known as ikons and are practiced by one of
          the most popular and ancient tribes of the country, the Saura
          tribe.<br /><br />
          These paintings are religiously important for them. These simple yet
          intricate drawings and paintings on the walls of village homes are
          dedicated to the main deity of the Sauras, Idital. Some common motifs
          are the sun, the moon, the tree of life, people, horses, and
          elephants. The base of these Saura paintings is prepared from red or
          yellow ochre and brushes used are created from tender bamboo shoots.

        <p class="para-p1">
          This is another tribal art form practiced by the second largest tribal
          community in India, the Bhils. The Bhils reside in Madhya Pradesh,
          Gujarat, Rajasthan, and Maharashtra and are highly superstitious
          people. Art is very important to them and the rich textures of their
          paintings connect their life to nature.<br><BR>The Bhil paintings are
          traditionally done on the clay walls of their village homes and neem
          sticks, twigs, and natural colors are used to do so. The bright and
          vibrant colors are extracted from turmeric, flour, vegetables, oil,
          and leaves. These Bhil paintings depict the everyday life of this
          tribe and they usually contain large shapes covered with uniform dots
          in numerous patterns and colors. These dots and patterns on a Bhil
          painting generally represent something that the artist wants like
          ancestors or deities.
