      <h1>Properties of colors</h1>
      <div class="hue">
        <p>
          <strong>Hue</strong> is the name given to a color, such as yellow,
          green, red, orange, blue, or purple. It refers to the specific
          wavelength of a color.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="sat">
        <p>
          <strong>Saturation</strong> is the color intensity or purity. The
          saturation level is determined by the extent to which a color has been
          mixed with another hue.<br />
          A highly saturated color is pure and intense. When painting, these
          colors come directly from the paint tube. Colors become more muted and
          less intense when combined with different hues.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="value">
        <p>
          <strong>Value</strong> is a color’s lightness or darkness. Mixing
          white or black with a hue can change a color’s value in drastic or
          subtle ways. In color value, a <strong>tint</strong> is when a color
          is mixed with white; a <strong>tone</strong> is when a color is mixed
          with gray; and a shade refers to when a color is mixed with black.

        <div class="prim">
          <h2>Primary</h2>
          <p>
            The three primary colors are red, yellow, and blue. Since primary
            colors can’t be re-created by blending colors, they are considered
            the building blocks from which all other colors are created. On the
            color wheel, primary colors are equally spaced apart.<br />Also
            known as the most basic colors on the color wheel,, the natural
            pigments in the three primary colors (RYB) make it possible for us
            to see the entire color spectrum of the world around us.

        <div class="sec">
          <h2>Secondary</h2>
          <p>
            Secondary colors are formed by mixing equal parts of two primary
            colors.<br />
            When looking at the color wheel, you can see the secondary colors
            between the primary ones.<br />
            <br />Green, orange, and purple are the three secondary colors
            created when mixing primary colors.<br />You can make green by
            mixing yellow and blue, orange from red and yellow, and purple from
            red and blue.

        <div class="tert">
          <h2>Tertiary</h2>
          <p>
            A tertiary color is created by mixing equal parts of a primary and
            secondary color.<br />
            On the color wheel, tertiary colors are positioned between primary
            and secondary colors.<br /><br />Combinations :<br /><br />Blue-green<br />

        <h1>Color Temperature</h1>
        <p>
          Color temperature is the visual warmth or coolness of a color.
          <br />Artists often use temperature to depict the atmosphere of an
          artwork.

        Paper is available in a range of formats, each uniquely suited to meet
        the varied needs of artists working on paper. Artists work on paper with
        a multitude of different media including graphite, charcoal,
        watercolour, inks, coloured pencil and pastel. Many artists choose to
        work on paper for its tactility, simplicity, and ease of use; formats
        like spiral or glued/gummed pads, sketchbooks, and blocks make working
        on paper convenient and inexpensive, letting artists have the
        versatility of working in the studio or on-the-go. These formats are
        perfect for producing quick sketches or detailed studies using a variety
        of mediums. They are suitable for use with traditional drawing media
        and, depending on the paper surface and quality, can also be worked on
        with watercolour, gouache, acrylics, oils, markers, and inks.

        <p>
          The first step to successful pencil shading is to control the movement
          of your pencil, making sure that every mark you make on the paper
          works towards creating the shading or modeling effect that you want.

        </div>
        <p>
          An alternative to regular 'sideways' pencil shading is to use small,
          overlapping circles. This is similar to 'scumbling' or the 'brillo
          pad' technique, except that the object here is to minimize texture,
          rather than create one.

        </div>
        <p>
          To prevent unwanted banding through a shaded area, change the pencil
          direction at irregular intervals, making one stroke long, then next
          short, overlapping where needed.

        <p>
          Direction - don't underestimate it! Here's a really rough change of
          direction: with two coarsely shaded areas side by side - there's no
          missing the difference! Drawn like this, it is screamingly obvious:
          one has a big horizontal movement, the other vertical, and the edge
          between the two is very clear.

        </div>
        <p>
          When using directional shading, you can vary the pressure on the
          pencil to create light and dark tones. Controlling it very precisely
          can allow you to model smooth forms. A more relaxed approach to
          lifting and re-weighting the pencil for a fairly continuous line is
          useful for creating highlights across textures like hair or grass.

          />
        </div>

        <p>
          Contour pencil shading uses directional shading which follows the
          contours of a form. In this example, contour shading is used in
          combination with line weight, adjusting the pressure to create light
          and shade. This allows you to create strong dimensional effects in
          your pencil drawing.

      <h1>Paint Brush</h1>
      <p>-> For staining the canvas, use the largest flat or filbert brush.<br><br>
        -> For sketching the composition, use a medium sized round brush, or sometimes even a fan brush if you want a very rough landscape sketch.<br><br>
        -> For blocking in general colors and shapes, use a medium to large filbert. Sometimes you can use a flat brush if the shapes are very angular.<br><br>
        -> For adding detail, use smaller filbert and round brushes. You can also use the fan brush in certain situations, such as for painting leaves, grass or water.<br><br>
        -> For signing the painting and adding very fine details, use a small round brush.</p>
